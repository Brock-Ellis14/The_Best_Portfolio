## Currently

Data Science student at BYU-Idaho seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities. 
Expecting to graduate by the end of 2026.

### Specialized in
Machine Learning, Financial Data Analysis.

## Education

`2022 - Present`
__Brigham Young University - Idaho__
*Data Science Major (AI Engineering & Statistics Minors)*
- **Career Specific GPA:** 3.9
- **Expected Graduation:** Fall 2026

## Projects

`October 2025`
__Multi-Horizon S&P 500 Forecasting Pipeline (R/Python)__
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline, extracting 120+ macro and technical indicators via Tidyquant and engineering a high-dimensional feature set of multi-period lags (3m, 6m, 1y, 2y) to capture short and long-term momentum.

- Developed a Random Forest / XGBoost Multi-Class Classifier in Python to categorize monthly returns into four risk regimes, ranging from "Strong Positive" ($>1.5\%$) to "Tail Risk" ($<-1.5\%$).

- Implemented Strict Sequential Splitting (Time-Series CV) to eliminate look-ahead bias/data leakage; achieved a 54% recall on "Strong Positive" returns, outperforming baseline random-walk expectations.

- Optimized model hyperparameters to address asymmetric loss, prioritizing the reduction of False Negatives in downside risk detection for improved capital preservation.

`December 2025`
__Economic Insights: Financial Crisis vs. Covid Crisis__
*Solo Project – Wrangling & Visualization*
- Engineered a comparative analysis of the 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 COVID shock using R (Tidyquant/XTS), pulling live data via FRED API to model the intersection of equity returns and macro indicators (Unemployment, CPI, Fed Funds).

- Quantified the "Diversification Melt-down" by constructing sector correlation heatmaps; identified a 25% surge in cross-sector synchronization during COVID (0.94+ correlation) compared to the more heterogeneous GFC regime.

- Modeled Tail Risk by calculating Maximum Drawdown and Risk-Return profiles for 11 SPDR sectors, demonstrating the transition from a demand-driven deflationary crisis (GFC) to a supply-driven inflationary shock (COVID).

`June 2025`
__MS Gene Expression Analysis__
*Solo Project – Wrangling & Stat Tests/Modeling*
- Analyzed gene expression data to identify Multiple Sclerosis biomarkers through statistical hypothesis testing and logistic regression modeling.

- Identified statistically significant differential expression in 2 immune-related genes with proper model validation.

## Experience

`Feb 2023 - Aug 2024`
__KeyBank__, Yakima WA
*Private Client Banker*
- Analyzed client financial data for 300+ accounts, achieving a 30% increase in product adoption and a 95% satisfaction rating.
- Facilitated loan applications and retirement planning, transitioning over $500,000 into investment products.
